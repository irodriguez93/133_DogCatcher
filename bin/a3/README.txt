To run program:
	After file is unzipped navigate to it's directory and 
	use the command "java a2.starter" 
	Then enter the amount of cats and dogs.
	You can now use the specified commands to play the game.
	
Changes:
	I have the original Up, Right, Down, Left keys working along with the arrow keys.
	I added getIndex() and objectAt() functions in the IIterator interface in order to 
		scratch a random dog within the fight collision function.
